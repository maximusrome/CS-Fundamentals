// With this assignment, you are completing your first project as
// a computer scientist.  Congratulations! At Northeastern, we
// believe that with great power comes great responsibility.  So
// as you take these first steps in developing your skills and
// powers, let's also begin our journey towards understanding the
// responsibilities of computing professionals.

// Computer scientists and software engineers around the world
// share a professional organization, the Association for Computing
// Machinery (ACM). The ACM's code of ethics begins:

//     "Computing professionals' actions change the world.
//      To act responsibly, they should reflect upon the
//      wider impacts of their work, consistently supporting
//      the public good. The ACM Code of Ethics and
//      Professional Conduct ("the Code") expresses the
//      conscience of the profession."

// So let's get comfortable with this document:
//
//     https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics
//
// Read it carefully, noting each of the ethical principles.
// Do any of them apply to your project?

// Now imagine that you are a software engineer tasked with further
// expanding the flashcard program you have just written and turning
// it into a commercial application...

// TODO 1/1: Below, using Kotlin comments, write a 3-6 sentence
//           memo to your manager that focuses on how your new
//           flashcard app will respect one of the ACM ethical
//           principles. Your memo should address the following
//           prompt:
//
//               As we prepare to release our app, we should
//               ensure that it respects ethical principle
//               #[number] by [taking the following concrete
//               actions]. These actions will ensure that
//               [bad potential consequence of deployment of
//               this app] is avoided and/or [good feature
//               of the app] is maintained.

//           Your memo will be graded with the following rubric:
//
//               + 1 point: mentions and discusses one of the
//                          ACM principles of ethics, putting
//                          direct quotes in quotation marks
//                          as appropriate.
//
//               + 1 point: describes a concrete action that
//                          your team could take in developing
//                          the app.
//
//               + 1 point: describes a clear consequence of not
//                          taking that action and relates it back
//                          to the principle of ethics mentioned
//                          in a logical way.

// Memo: Ethical Consideration for Flashcard App Development
// To: Manager
// From: Alexander Rome (Max)
// Subject: Adherence to ACM Ethical Principle 2.5 in Flashcard App Development
// In anticipation of our upcoming flashcard app's release, I would like to highlight
// the importance of adhering to the ACM Ethical Principle 2.5: "Give comprehensive 
// and thorough evaluations of computer systems and their impacts, including analysis
// of possible risks." This principle emphasizes the responsibility of computing 
// professionals to provide objective, thorough evaluations and to consider the 
// potential risks associated with our software. To embody this principle, our team 
// should conduct extensive testing and user feedback sessions to identify and mitigate 
// any potential risks, especially those related to data privacy and user safety. 
// This includes thorough testing for software vulnerabilities and ensuring the app 
// does not inadvertently expose user data. Failing to rigorously evaluate and 
// mitigate risks could lead to significant harm, such as data breaches or misuse of 
// user information, which could damage our reputation and trust with users. By 
// rigorously testing and evaluating our app, we uphold the ACMâ€™s ethical standards 
// and ensure the safety and satisfaction of our users.
